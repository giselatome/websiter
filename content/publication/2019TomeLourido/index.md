summary: It has long been debated whether speech production and perception remain
  flexible in adulthood. The current study investigates the effects of language dominance
  switch in Galician new speakers (neofalantes) who are raised with Spanish as a primary
  language and learn Galician at an early age in a bilingual environment, but in adolescence,
  decide to switch to using Galician almost exclusively, for ideological reasons.
  Results showed that neofalantes pattern with Spanish-dominants in their perception
  and production of mid-vowel and fricative contrasts, but with Galician-dominants
  in their realisation of unstressed word-final vowels, a highly salient feature of
  Galician. These results are taken to suggest that despite early exposure to Galician,
  high motivation and almost exclusive Galician language use post-switch, there are
  limitations to what neofalantes can learn in both production and perception, but
  that the hybrid categories they appear to develop may function as opportunities
  to mark identity within a particular community.

summary: When listening to a familiar accent, perceived speaker-specific information can affect low-level speech perception (e.g. Strand 1999) and lexical access (e.g. Koops et al. 2008), arguably facilitating processing. Previous work used pictures or words to cue a specific indexical category (e.g. gender, age, region) explicitly. Study 1 used the Visual World Paradigm to investigate whether brief exposure to accent-specific phonetic features influences the time course of spoken word recognition. We tested the TRAP-BATH and FOOT-STRUT lexical sets, which are known for distinguishing Northern and Southern varieties of British English. Southern Standard British English (SSBE), contrasts TRAP and BATH ([æ]-[ɑː]) and FOOT and STRUT ([ʊ]-[ʌ]), whilst Leeds English, does not have these pairwise contrasts (TRAP/BATH: [æ]; FOOT/STRUT: [ʊ]). Two monolingual English listener groups were tested (N=41): 24 born and raised in the north of England and 17 born and raised in the south of England. Results from generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) indicate that both listener groups looked at the target significantly earlier when listening to SSBE, being able to use the vowel distinction in TRAP-BATH and FOOT- STRUT sets to discard the competitor word faster. These findings provide further evidence that information about a talker’s accent, even when it is not provided explicitly, is used in spoken word recognition, and that listeners are able to use categories that do not exist in their native repertoire in speech processing. Study 2 also used the Visual World Paradigm to investigate how bilinguals process words containing non-native phonological categories. We presented words containing Galician-specific contrasts (/ɛ/-/e/, /ɔ/-/o/ and /ʃ/-/s/) to 43 Galician-dominant (N= 22) and Spanish-dominant (N= 21) bilinguals. Results showed there were no significant differences between the two bilingual groups for words containing Galician-specific contrasts and that lexical activation was similar for both groups for competitors that contained the mid-vowel contrast and the sibilant fricatives. These findings are in line with neurophysiological evidence from work on Catalan-Spanish bilinguals (Sebastián-Gallés et al., 2006) which suggests that Catalan-dominant bilinguals might have two different acoustic representations for such words in their lexicons. Taken together, these findings contribute to our understanding of how accent variation is processed in monolingual and bilingual listeners and how social information is used in speech perception.
